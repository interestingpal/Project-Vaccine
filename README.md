Project Vaccine (autoit prototype released)


Project vaccine, the world’s first open source anti malware software.. made with the aim of completely wiping off  all the malwares from the entire cyber space…

suppose you have a fever..and the doc prescribe you to take antibiotics for a week….and you have it for lets say,4 days
and you are completely cured…but still the virus is still in you…and waiting for a condition to pop up again..and gain control over you…similarly not everyone in this cyber space have good antiviruses(and personally i dont use any antiviruses for the past 6 years)to protect them against the latest threats….so even those viruses which were released 20 years before and considered to be extinct   still exist somewhere in this cyber space…

so vaccine takes all the best out of viruses..and use it against them….for eg: “The Vaccine” spreads like a virus..
therby making it possible to reach about 90% of the windows computers in the cyber space within a span of 2 years..

so each and every computer “the vaccine” gets installed not only disinfects it but also , silently protects those computers from further ictions….
The age of money sucking premium antiviruses are over…. its the era of open source ant-viruses..!!
making  a complete database which can remove any virus is impossible...but we surely can cripple it...
